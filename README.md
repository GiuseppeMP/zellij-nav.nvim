# zellij-nav.nvim

This is a Neovim plugin, which integrates window navigation with
[zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij).

It creates four new commands, which will move between windows inside Neovim
(like `^w h` et al.), but once it hits the edge of your editor it will attempt
to switch to the next zellij pane.

Commands:

- `ZellijNavigateLeft`
- `ZellijNavigateDown`
- `ZellijNavigateUp`
- `ZellijNavigateRight`

It also exports the lua versions, which you can call like this:

- `require("zellij-nav").left()`
- `require("zellij-nav").down()`
- `require("zellij-nav").up()`
- `require("zellij-nav").right()`

This is written in the spirit of
[vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/alexghergh/nvim-tmux-navigation/), but
for zellij instead, while also staying as simple and lightweight as possible.

## Installing

### [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) (recommended)

```lua
{
  "https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/zellij-nav.nvim",
  lazy = true,
  event = "VeryLazy",
  keys = {
    { "<c-h>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateLeft<cr>",  { silent = true, desc = "navigate left"  } },
    { "<c-j>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateDown<cr>",  { silent = true, desc = "navigate down"  } },
    { "<c-k>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateUp<cr>",    { silent = true, desc = "navigate up"    } },
    { "<c-l>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateRight<cr>", { silent = true, desc = "navigate right" } },
  },
  opts = {},
}
```

### [pckr](https://github.com/lewis6991/pckr.nvim)

```lua
{
  "https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/zellij-nav.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("zellij-nav").setup()

    local map = vim.keymap.set
    map("n", "<c-h>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateLeft<cr>",  { desc = "navigate left"  })
    map("n", "<c-j>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateDown<cr>",  { desc = "navigate down"  })
    map("n", "<c-k>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateUp<cr>",    { desc = "navigate up"    })
    map("n", "<c-l>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateRight<cr>", { desc = "navigate right" })

  end
}
```

### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/zellij-nav.nvim'
lua require("zellij-nav").setup()

nnoremap <c-h> <cmd>ZellijNavigateLeft<cr>
nnoremap <c-j> <cmd>ZellijNavigateDown<cr>
nnoremap <c-k> <cmd>ZellijNavigateUp<cr>
nnoremap <c-l> <cmd>ZellijNavigateRight<cr>
```

## Configuring Zellij

This plugin only covers the Neovim side of things. To get to a fully
seamless workflow, we need zellij to do a few things too.

In an ideal world, we could map `C-hjkl` to work identically across both zellij
and Neovim, but that's not possible. Unfortunately, today, zellij has a few
problems, which prevent us from getting to that point.

First, zellij doesn't allow us to bind `C-j` to anything. This is a [known bug](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2679).

Second, and more critically, upon any of the `C-hjkl` keystrokes in zellij, we
need to be able to:

1. Determine whether the focussed pane is running `nvim`.
2. If so, forward the keystrokes to the application; for example, using the
   zellij `Write` action.
3. If not, act on the keystroke directly in zellij by using the `MoveFocus
   <direction>` action.

Presently, I have not figured out a way to do this, even through the [zellij plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins).

Thus, my configuration uses `A-hjkl` in zellij. So, I use `C-hjkl` to move
around within Neovim, and to move from Neovim to another zellij pane. But if
I'm in a non-`nvim` zellij pane, I just use `A-hjkl` to switch panes. It's not
ideal, but it's the best I know today.
